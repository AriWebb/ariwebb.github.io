title:  "Introducing Butterfly"
---

Over the course of the past few weeks, I have been working on a side project I call Butterfly. It is a simple web app built using Svelte that helps my girlfriend and I stay in touch with each other when we are far apart.

I put the core of the website behind Google Auth, so it isn't fully public. The domain, though, is [butterfly-distance.xyz](butterfly-distance.xyz). If you go there, you can see my fun CSS animation sign in page.
