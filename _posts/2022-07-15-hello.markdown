Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! Read on to find out more about this website:

## Inspiration

I was initially inspired to build this website by my friend James Qiu, who recently [built][james] a similar one. 

## Organization

You can find more info about me in the about tab in the upper right hand corner, alongside my past and future stock picks and some of my coding projects. You can also find my GitHub, LinkedIn and Instagram at the foot of the page.

## Source Code

I'm a big fan of the open source movement. So, in the spirit of transparency, the repo for this website is on GitHub [here][website]. Jekyll, Minimal Mistakes and using James' website as reference made making this site super easy! If you are reading this and want to make your own site, definitely poke around my repo!
