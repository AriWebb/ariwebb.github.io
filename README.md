# ariwebb.github.io Website Repo
Ari Webb

## Motivation:

I wanted to make this website so that I could have a place to share with the world a little bit about myself and my coding projects. I was inspired to build this by my friend James Qiu, you can find his website [here][james]. I encourage anyone looking at this to take a look at his website too!

## Codebase:

Putting together this website was super quick! It is hosted through [GitHub][github] and built using the [Jekyll][jekyll] and [minimal mistakes][mistakes] frameworks. Look at the three preceeding links to find more info. Feel free also to clone the repo to gain insight into what makes it work and how you can build your own!
