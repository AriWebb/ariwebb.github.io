I will try to keep this list updated with all of my stock picks. I don't include any of the day trades I've made in the past, as there are frankly way too many. Instead, I only have my long term holdings here. I value honesty, so I'm transparent even about my big losses.

## Watchlist:

SNAP, AMZN, DOCU, TSLA

## Current Portfolio: 

6/3/22 <span style="color:green">BUY</span> 34% META
5/9/22 <span style="color:green">BUY</span> 33% NFLX, 33% NVDA

## Prior Holdings:

5/9/22 <span style="color:red">SELL</span> 50% ACB 
3/15/21 <span style="color:green">BUY</span> 50% ACB
2013 <span style="color:green">BUY</span> HPQ and FSBW
