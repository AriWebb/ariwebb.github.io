I will try to keep this list updated with all of my stock picks. I don't include any of the day trades I've made in the past, as there are frankly way too many. Instead, I only have my long term holdings here.

## Watchlist:

SNAP, AMZN, DOCU, TSLA

## Current Portfolio: 

6/3/22 <span style="color:green">BUY</span> META\
5/9/22 <span style="color:green">BUY</span> NFLX, NVDA\
Rationale:\
META: Meta has an incredible revenue stream. It has a PE ratio of 12 at a valuation of 450b, making it a great long run value play. I'm not fully onboard with the whole metaverse thing yet, but even if the meteverse is a massive flop, I still think META is in a great position to continue dominating the social media space for years to come.\
NFLX: It seems most people are concerned with NFLX subscriber loss. I think this is a valid concern, but I don't think that warrants the massive selloff the stock has seen. With a PE of 18 at 85b valuation, I think NFLX is another good value play.\
NVDA: Seems to be the most innovative chip producer to me. They are positioned great to dominate the coming demand for graphics processing in self-driving cars among other things.

## Prior Holdings (Incomplete):

5/9/22 <span style="color:red">SELL</span> ACB\
