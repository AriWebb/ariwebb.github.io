My name is Ari Webb. I'm an undergrad at Stanford University studying Computer Science and Philosophy. I am a staff writer at the [Stanford Review][review], I play for the [Men's Frisbee Team][blood] and I'm a member of [SigEp][sigep].

Growing up, I worked in my family real estate business in various capacities, played tennis and built model airplanes. I also have always had a fascination with the stock market. In 5th Grade I read The Warren Buffett Way and bought my first stock (HPQ). 

I now intern at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
