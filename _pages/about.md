My name is Ari Webb. I'm an undergrad at Stanford University studying Computer Science and Philosophy. I will also be continuing my education through 2025 as a coterm MS CS student. In my freetime, I enjoy reading (Philosophy or nonfiction mostly), listening to music/playing the guitar, going to the gym and going hiking.

In the past, I have been a staff writer at the [Stanford Review][review], played for the [Men's Frisbee Team][blood] and was a member of [SigEp][sigep]. I also interned at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Nile Secure and Splunk. I am currently looking for positions for Summer 2024.

This past Fall, I studied abroad at Stanford in Oxford.

Growing up, I worked in my family real estate business in various capacities, played tennis and built model airplanes. I also have always had a fascination with the stock market. In 5th Grade I read The Warren Buffett Way and bought my first stock (HPQ).
